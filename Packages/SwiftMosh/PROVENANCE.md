## Waycar patches

Patches 1–6 were written from protocol behavior observed on the wire against
mosh-server 1.4.0, without consulting mosh's (GPL) source. The protocol
semantics behind patches 7 and 8 (which state number means shutdown, when
mosh-server exits, what resets its network timeout, how it discards states)
were checked against the mosh 1.4.0 source; no code, comments, or names were
taken.

1. **Server shutdown** (`MoshClientSession`). The maximum state number is the
   server's shutdown state, sent when its command exits. It is applied like
   any state (it carries the final screen), acknowledged (sent three times, so
   one lost datagram does not strand mosh-server), and the session then ends
   `.stopped` with no failure and its host streams finished. Upstream kept the
   session running forever after the remote command exited.
2. **Prompt re-ack** (`MoshClientSession`). A state that repeats or precedes
   the latest applied one, or is built on a base this client never received,
   is not applied and triggers an ack within ~20–70 ms rather than after the
   3 s ack interval, so the server re-bases sooner. Upstream also applied a
   repeated-but-older state, which could roll the screen back.
3. **Timestamp replies** (`TransportEngine`). Each outgoing packet echoes the
   peer's latest timestamp once, advanced by how long it was held (under 1 s),
   so mosh-server can measure round-trip time and pace its frames. A reply
   that would equal `UInt16.max`, the wire's "no reply", is sent as one less,
   as outgoing timestamps are. Upstream always sent "no reply", which left the
   server at its slowest frame interval: over the same workload 48 frames
   instead of ~255, and keystroke echo on localhost at a median of 182 ms
   instead of 67 ms.
4. **Stop during start** (`MoshClientSession`). `start()` waits for its
   endpoint to connect, which `NetworkDatagramEndpoint` never does while the
   device is offline or the host name does not resolve. Upstream kept that
   engine local to `start()`, so `stop()` could not reach it and `start()`
   never returned. The connecting engine is now held where `stop()` (and a
   failure, the remote shutdown, or app suspension) stops it; `start()` then
   throws `MoshSessionError.notStarted` and leaves the state to whatever
   stopped it, `.stopped` after a `stop()`. A transport restart after a
   receive error connects the same way and is cancelled the same way.
   `start()` also refuses to run while a `stop()` is still tearing down,
   which could otherwise drop the new engine without stopping it.
5. **Debug detail.** The `SWIFTMOSH_DEBUG_REAL_E2E=1` decode log line also
   prints each instruction's state numbers.
6. **Upstream coverage tests removed.** The five `…Coverage` tests in
   `CoreAndAdapterTests.swift` (`testSessionStartBranchCoverageAndFailureReset`,
   `testSessionFailureHooksAndClassificationCoverage`,
   `testSessionCoverageDecodeAndMaintenanceBranches`,
   `testSessionRttAndReliabilityBranchCoverageHelpers`,
   `testAckWithoutDirtyStateAndFutureLastSendCoverage`) and the `_test*`
   hooks in `MoshClientSession` only they called are deleted. They drove
   private branches through those hooks with synthetic state rather than
   through the session's lifecycle; the ack, retransmit, heartbeat, and
   decode tests in the same file cover that logic through the public API.
   `_testRunReceiveLoopIteration` and `_testPendingOutboundCount` stay, as
   other tests use them. Re-vendoring must not bring the deleted ones back.
7. **Client shutdown** (`MoshClientSession.shutdown(ackTimeoutMs:)`). Quits
   the way mosh's own client does: sends the shutdown state (new state number
   `UInt64.max`) until the server acknowledges it (ack number `UInt64.max`) or
   the deadline passes (default 1 s; resent every 100 ms), then stops like
   `stop()` and ends `.stopped`. mosh-server exits, ending its command, once it
   has acknowledged that state; upstream had only `stop()`, which leaves the
   server and its command running until the server's own network timeout, and
   forever without one. The state is an empty diff on the newest state sent,
   so it carries all input: on an older base it would drop input the server
   may already have applied, which mosh-server cannot diff (an assertion, or
   an out-of-bounds read with asserts compiled out). mosh-server ignores it
   until that base arrives, so unacknowledged states keep being retransmitted
   meanwhile. The deadline holds even when a send never completes
   (NWConnection completes none while its path is not ready): at the
   deadline the runtime stops, cancelling the connection, which fails that
   send. Concurrent callers share one shutdown; a session that is not running
   just stops.
8. **Idle heartbeat is a new state; throwaway is the acknowledged state**
   (`MoshClientSession`). mosh-server's `MOSH_SERVER_NETWORK_TMOUT` counts
   from the client's last *new* state; a repeated state number does not reset
   it. Upstream's heartbeat repeated the current state, so with that timeout
   set the server cut off any session idle for its length. With nothing left
   to retransmit, the heartbeat is now a new, empty state (as mosh's own
   client's idle ack is), due `heartbeatIntervalMs` after the last new state
   however many acks went out since; otherwise it repeats the state as
   before. Every instruction's throwaway number is now the newest state the
   server acknowledged. Upstream sent the first unacknowledged state, or 0
   with none pending, so the server kept every state, and at 1024 its queue
   limit starts refusing new ones for 15 s at a time; heartbeat states alone
   would reach that within an hour. A new state is also recorded before its
   send suspends, so a heartbeat or shutdown state sent meanwhile builds on
   it rather than reusing its number (which would have lost the input).
   Delivery then belongs to the retransmit queue: `enqueue` throws only when
   the session is not running (checked again after the pacing delay, so no
   input follows a shutdown state), not when the first send fails, and input
   typed during a transport swap is retransmitted instead of dropped. The
   retransmit queue updates a state's entry before its send suspends too:
   upstream wrote it back afterwards, reviving a state acknowledged during
   the send where no later ack could remove it, which stopped the idle
   heartbeat's new states for good (4 of 6 idle sessions against a real
   mosh-server within 5 minutes). The heartbeat checks
   `pendingOutboundOrder`, the list acks prune.
9. **Detached server pid** (`MoshServerLauncher.launchLocalServer`, tests
   only). mosh-server prints `MOSH CONNECT` before it forks and
   `[mosh-server detached, pid = N]` after; the launcher returned as soon as
   the first line parsed, with the pid of its own child, which exits at the
   fork. The tests' SIGTERM then missed the detached server and left it (and
   its `cat`) running: one such server had been alive almost two days. The
   launcher now waits for the pid line, reading the pipe to its end once that
   child exits, and returns no pid without it; `MoshProtocolE2ETests`' own
   launcher parses the line instead of returning its child's pid. A pid of 0
   or 1 is not a server's and is ignored.
10. **Process-local transport clock** (`TransportClock.nowMs()`). Upstream
    returned milliseconds since device boot (`ProcessInfo.systemUptime`), and
    that value mod 65536 goes into every datagram's timestamp. The app's
    privacy manifest declares boot-time access with reason `35F9.1`, which
    lets only elapsed time between in-app events leave the device, so the
    clock now counts from its first reading in this process, plus 1000 ms so
    a reading is never 0 (callers treat 0 as "unset"). It stays monotonic.
    It reads `ContinuousClock`, which keeps counting while the device sleeps
    (`systemUptime` does not), so the network timeout (patch 12) counts a
    suspension in full.
    Readings are not comparable across launches; nothing compares them so
    (`MoshSnapshot.createdAtMs` and the transport snapshot's
    `lastSentAtMs`/`lastReceivedAtMs` are stored but never read back as
    times, and `install(blob:)` restarts retransmit timers from the current
    reading).
11. **Connectivity** (`MoshClientSession.connectivityStream()`,
    `connectivity`, `MoshClientConfig.stallThresholdMs`, `MoshConnectivity`).
    The session records when its last authenticated server datagram arrived
    (start counts as contact) and publishes `.stalled` once
    `stallThresholdMs` (default 5 s) passes without one, `.connected` as soon
    as one arrives. Judged on each maintenance pass (50 ms) and on receipt,
    only while running; the stream yields the current value on subscription
    and finishes when the session stops or fails. mosh-server 1.4 answers
    an idle client's empty heartbeat state (patch 8) only on its 3 s ack
    interval, so a healthy idle session hears from it about every 3 s: a
    threshold above two intervals (mosh's own client uses 6.5 s) rides out
    one lost datagram. Upstream had no liveness signal at all.
12. **Network timeout enforced** (`MoshClientConfig.networkTimeoutMs`).
    Upstream declared it (default 30 s) and `MoshSessionFailure.timeout` but
    used neither, so a dead server left the session running forever. Now
    no authenticated server datagram for that long fails the session with
    `.timeout(timeoutMs:)`. It is measured from the last contact on
    `TransportClock`, so time the process spent suspended counts: the first
    maintenance pass after a long suspension ends the session. The upstream
    test asserting that silence never ends the session
    (`testNetworkSilenceDoesNotEndSession`) now asserts the timeout.
13. **Rebind** (`MoshClientSession.rebindTransport()`). For network path
    changes: replaces the UDP flow at once with a new one (a new
    `NWConnection`, so a fresh ephemeral local port unless
    `config.localPort` pins one), resends every unacknowledged state and
    then sends patch 15's state, so the server roams to the new address
    and, with a size sent before, answers within its 100 ms ack delay (a
    resent state it already holds draws no reply; an empty one waits for
    its 3 s ack interval). It reuses the transport restart, which now
    claims the engine before suspending (a receive failure and a rebind
    cannot both replace it), stops the old engine before reading its
    sequence state (no datagram it sends can reuse a sequence number, the
    cipher's nonce, that the replacement sends again), and keeps that state
    in the pending transport snapshot until the replacement is installed,
    so `makeSnapshot()` or a suspension during the swap no longer starts
    over from sequence 0. The receive loop treats the end of a replaced
    engine's receive as no failure (no backoff sleep) and waits for a
    replacement still connecting instead of ending or spinning; a stop or
    suspension ends that wait.
14. **Abandon** (`MoshClientSession.abandon()`). Ends the session at once
    without the shutdown handshake, for a server presumed dead, where
    `shutdown(ackTimeoutMs:)` would wait out its 1 s deadline. Nothing more
    is sent; the runtime stops (which also ends a `shutdown` in flight), the
    host and connectivity streams finish, unacknowledged input is dropped,
    and a failed session keeps its failure (`stop()` keeps the input and
    overwrites the failed state).
15. **Elicited reply** (`MoshClientSession.elicitServerReply()`). mosh-server
    1.4 acknowledges a new client state at once only when its diff is
    non-empty (`Transport::recv` calls `set_data_ack()` only then); an empty
    state waits for its 3 s ack interval. To hear from the server now (a
    roam, a liveness check) this sends a new state repeating the last size
    sent with `enqueue(.resize(cols:rows:))`: a no-op for the server, since
    its terminal has that size and a same-size `TIOCSWINSZ` raises no
    SIGWINCH on Linux or the BSDs. Before any resize it falls back to a new
    empty state and returns false (no prompt reply due); keystrokes are
    never repeated. Not paced by `sendMinDelayMs`; returns false without
    sending when not running. *Amendment:* `enqueue` records a resize's size
    before its send suspends (as patch 8 records the state itself), so
    an elicited state racing that send repeats the new size; recording it
    after the send let a rebind or contact check re-send the old size as a
    later state, leaving the server's terminal at the size the client left.
16. **Client screen model** (`MoshScreen`, `MoshScreenEncoder`,
    `MoshCharacterWidth`, `MoshClientSession.repaintScreen(cols:rows:)`).
    Written clean-room from ECMA-48 / xterm semantics and the bytes
    mosh-server 1.4.0 was observed to send; mosh's (GPL) source was not
    consulted. Every server state is a diff that turns its base state's
    screen into the new one, skipping cells the two share and scrolling with
    LF. When acks trail the server's patience it builds on the client's last
    acknowledged state, older than the screen already shown; upstream
    applied those diffs on top of the newer screen, which ran scrolls twice
    and left stale cells that the server, believing the screen right, never
    redrew. The session now keeps a screen per recent state (state 0 is a
    blank 80×24) and applies each state's host message (resize, then bytes)
    to a copy of its base's screen. Screens below the server's throwaway
    number are dropped; beyond 256 screens or 4M cells (rows × columns,
    summed) the oldest are evicted, but never the displayed one nor the
    oldest held one, which is the server's fallback base. A state on the
    displayed base publishes the server's ops unchanged; one on an older
    base publishes a repaint from the displayed screen to the new one
    instead (the size change if any, a replayed upward scroll so Ghostty
    keeps its scrollback, then only the rows that differ, the modes, titles,
    a changed clipboard, the cursor and the current rendition), plus its
    echo acks. Scroll detection compares rows by hash and tries only the
    distances the target's first few rows suggest; rows are then compared
    exactly, so a missed scroll costs bytes, not correctness. An empty diff
    on an older base returns the screen to that base. A base no longer
    held, or any state on a session restored from a snapshot (snapshots
    carry no screens), is passed through as upstream did, the displayed
    screen tracking what the terminal was sent. `repaintScreen(cols:rows:)`
    publishes a full repaint of the displayed screen through the host-op
    stream, in order and with no round trip, when that screen has the given
    size (at another size the server's state for the new size repaints); it
    never clears (Ghostty would push the screen into scrollback) or sets the
    clipboard again, and does nothing before the first state or on a
    restored session. The parser never traps: it ignores sequences outside
    the vocabulary, bounds resizes to 512×256, and bounds combining marks
    and OSC strings. Character widths must equal the Host's `wcwidth`,
    which mosh-server lays out with. Wide (2) scalars come from
    `MoshCharacterWidthTable`, generated by
    `Scripts/generate-character-widths.swift` from Darwin's `wcwidth_l`
    (en_US.UTF-8, Unicode 15.0, macOS 27.0.1, 26A434; recorded in
    `MoshCharacterWidthTable.sourceDescription`; `--check` reports drift);
    lookup is a binary search. Mn/Me/Cf (except U+00AD), Zl/Zp, U+200B and
    U+1160–11FF are 0, as on Darwin, except that Darwin also zeroes Mc
    spacing marks and the model gives them 1. A glibc Host differs (source
    review of glibc's `utf8_gen.py` at HEAD): U+3248–324F and U+4DC0–4DFF
    are 2 there; its Unicode version differs (2.35 treats Unicode 15 emoji
    as unassigned, -1, which mosh-server ignores; 2.39 counts U+2FFC–2FFF
    and U+31EF as wide); it zeroes Default_Ignorable_Code_Point rather than
    Cf, so Prepended_Concatenation_Mark Cf scalars are 1 and U+3164/U+FFA0
    are 0; and it zeroes Hangul V/T jamo by HangulSyllableType, adding
    U+D7B0–D7FB. The `MoshCharacterWidth` doc comment lists these. (Hand-made
    emoji ranges once counted 👁 as 2 columns; omp's status row then
    autowrapped the model and every later row drifted, #148.)
    `_testOlderBaseStateCount()` is a Waycar test hook (the real-server
    suite asserts older-base states arrived); re-vendoring must keep it.
17. **Test clock and hooks** (`MoshClientSession`'s internal init,
    `TransportEngine`'s internal init, `NetworkDatagramEndpoint`).
    `TransportEngine` takes the clock it stamps packets with and measures a
    held peer timestamp's hold to (patch 3; default `TransportClock`), so a
    test that also stamps its datagrams' arrival with that clock sets the
    hold exactly. The session's internal init takes the session's clock
    (default `TransportClock.nowMs()`), and every window the session
    measures reads it: stall, network timeout, heartbeat, retransmission,
    acks, pacing and the shutdown deadline. It also takes the sleep that
    waits out the pacing delay (default `Task.sleep`), so a test can hold
    input in pacing for as long as it needs. The shutdown's backstop sleep,
    which ends a shutdown whose send never completes, stays real-time; its
    length is the deadline the clock also measures. RTT samples
    keep `TransportClock`, since they compare against timestamps the
    session's engine stamps with it. Tests that assert on those windows pass a clock they
    move by hand (`ManualClock`), so a loaded Mac's scheduler pause is not
    silence: CI on the shared runner saw `[connected, stalled, connected]`
    from the idle-heartbeat test, whose 400 ms stall threshold ran on the
    real clock. `_testRunMaintenanceLoopIteration()` runs one maintenance
    pass at the clock's current time, so a test knows a moment was judged;
    `NetworkDatagramEndpoint._testPendingReceiveCount()` tells a test a
    receive is waiting before it delivers an error or stops the endpoint
    (an error with no receive waiting is dropped). Sessions build their
    engines, and the app its sessions, with the public inits only, so
    nothing changes outside tests. Re-vendoring must keep the seams and
    both hooks.
18. **A stopped connection's late callbacks** (`NetworkDatagramEndpoint`,
    B-28). `stop()` cancels its `NWConnection`, which reports `.cancelled`
    (and completes a pending receive) later, on its queue. Upstream's
    callbacks carried no identity, so arriving after a restart they acted on
    the new connection: a `.cancelled` failed the new `start()`, a receive
    error failed a receive waiting on the new connection and armed a second
    receive there, and a datagram received late waited in the buffer for the
    next start to deliver. Each start now numbers its connection and every
    callback carries that number; one from a connection the endpoint no
    longer holds is ignored. `MoshClientSession` builds a new endpoint for
    every engine, so the app never restarts one; the fix is for any caller
    that does.
19. **Endpoint state machine** (`DatagramEndpointMachine`,
    `StateMachine`). The endpoint's connection lifecycle (stopped,
    connecting, open, failed) is one pure value type, as the app's
    lifecycles are (its `docs/design/state-machines.md`); the package
    declares the same `StateMachine` protocol with `package` access, since
    it cannot see the app's. `NetworkDatagramEndpoint` feeds it every call
    and callback and performs what it returns; the machine's connection
    token is patch 18's number. Behaviour is patch 18's, plus one stale
    case of the same kind: a `start()` that returns after a `stop()` and
    a new `start()` no longer arms a second receive on the new connection.
    No wire or timing change.

`Tests/SwiftMoshTests/WaycarPatchTests.swift` covers the shutdown state
(final screen applied, maximum state acked, session ends `.stopped` without a
failure); the prompt re-ack for a state on a base never received and for a
resent state older than the latest (not applied, re-acked within the test's
wait, against an ack interval beyond it); the timestamp reply (echoed once, advanced by its hold
time); `stop()` ending a `start()` whose endpoint never connects; the client
shutdown (built on the newest state with that state still retransmitted,
ended by the server's ack well before its deadline, ended at the deadline by
a silent server and by a send that never completes, and refusing input paced
past its start); the idle heartbeat (a new empty state whose throwaway is the
acknowledged state); and an ack that arrives while that state's
retransmission is being sent. Each case fails against upstream v0.1.8. The
real-server suite proves the client shutdown end to end (mosh-server and its
command both exit; it fails with `stop()` in its place) and an idle session
outliving two `MOSH_SERVER_NETWORK_TMOUT` periods. `MoshBootstrapTests`
covers the launcher waiting for the detached pid, reporting none without it,
and ignoring pids 0 and 1. Not covered: the reply's step off `UInt16.max`,
cancelling a transport restart, refusing `start()` during a stop, and the
debug line. `TransportTests` covers the process-local clock (non-zero, starts
small, never decreases); that it counts device sleep is not testable on the
host. It also covers patch 18 with a fake connection per start: a late
`.cancelled`, a late receive error and a late datagram from a stopped
connection leave the restarted endpoint alone (each fails against the
unpatched endpoint). `DatagramEndpointMachineTests` covers patch 19's
transitions, stale tokens included.

`Tests/SwiftMoshTests/WaycarNetworkPatchTests.swift` covers patches 11 and
13–15: connectivity stalling on silence, recovering on the next server
datagram (which counts as contact) and finishing with the session; an idle
session the server answers staying connected and alive across several
thresholds and timeouts; a rebind opening a new flow, releasing the old one,
resending the unacknowledged state and then a new state, still receiving
from the server, receiving its first reply without a receive backoff sleep,
drawing a prompt reply from a server that acks only non-empty states,
sending from a new local port on real loopback UDP, and, stalled on a flow
that never connects, keeping the sequence state in a snapshot, returning
when the session stops and letting the session be released;
`elicitServerReply()` repeating the last size (not the
last input) and drawing that server's reply, falling back to an empty
state before any resize, and sending nothing once stopped; `abandon()`
returning without a shutdown state, dropping unacknowledged input,
finishing both streams and ending a `shutdown` in flight; and the first
input after `start()` going out without the pacing delay (mosh-server
starts its command on the first client datagram, which is the app's
initial size). `CoreAndAdapterTests` covers the network timeout (patch 12)
and `abandon()` keeping a failed session's failure.
The rebind, abandon and first-input cases assert the mechanism (no backoff
sleep taken, contact recorded, states sent) rather than elapsed times of
tens of milliseconds. The real-server suite also proves an idle mosh-server
answers the elicited state well inside its 3 s ack interval.

`Tests/SwiftMoshTests/MoshScreenTests.swift` covers patch 16's parser with
hand-written expectations (cursor moves, CR/LF/BS including BS with a wrap
pending, LF scrolling the screen and a DECSTBM region, erases with the
current background, autowrap and soft-wrap, wide characters, half
overwrites and a wide character wrapping off a full row, combining marks,
character widths (including the symbols in omp's status row), SGR forms, OSC
titles and clipboard with BEL and ST, modes, unknown sequences, resize,
garbage input) and its encoder by seeded random round trips: a screen fed
the bytes encoded towards a related screen, an unrelated one or one of
another size renders equal to it, and a full repaint paints over an
unrelated screen; plus scroll replay, a region scroll above a fixed footer,
soft-wrap continuation, and the cell after a wide character staying put
when the terminal measures it narrow; and a 59-column omp status row with
two 👁 written sequentially, which keeps every later row and the cursor in
place (with the old hand-made widths the row autowrapped and the rows below
it shifted). On macOS, the generated wide table equals the recorded libc's
`wcwidth` for every scalar and each range bound ±1 (skipped on any other
macOS build), and the zero-width rules equal the running Host's `wcwidth`
for every scalar it knows, Mc aside.
`MoshScreenSessionTests.swift` feeds every published op into a terminal
model. Each older-base case fails against upstream (verified by disabling
the older-base path): a state built on base 1 after state 2 (upstream: 3 of
5 rows wrong, a line doubled), a cell the older-base diff skips (upstream:
"count 21" for "count 20"), an empty state on an older base (upstream: keeps
the newer text), the throwaway state kept as a base (fails if pruning drops
it), an older base across a resize (upstream: keeps the 30×6 screen), a
region scroll above a changing status row (upstream: the region scrolled
three times, "status 21"), and a skipped cell below omp's full-width status
row (upstream: "model 21"; the old widths: the status row wrapped and the
rows above it shifted up). Separately, `repaintScreen` publishes between the
server's states and nothing before the first state or at another size. The
real-server suite (local mosh-server 1.4.0, macOS 27.0.1) runs 300 numbered
lines with every client datagram sent 150 ms late, so mosh-server builds
63–73 states on older bases; the terminal ends exact (upstream: 11–18 of 24
rows wrong over four runs). It also runs 300 rounds of an 80-column omp
status row (two 👁, 🌳) plus a numbered line under the same delay: one run
each, 27 older-base states and the terminal exact, where the old hand-made
widths left 19 of 24 rows wrong (24 older-base states). Both cases' stand-in
terminal is a `MoshScreen`, so it shares the width function under test.
Three upstream tests in `MoshProtocolE2ETests` assumed every diff applies on
top of the last: `testServerSendsMultipleStatesBeforeClientAcks`
now checks the terminal shows the last state, and the simulated servers in
`testInitialConnectionDoesNotBlackScreen` and
`testRapidKeystrokeEchoRoundTrip` send each diff against its base.

## Known limitations

- **A base the client no longer holds is applied on top of the displayed
  screen** (upstream's rule): after the screen or cell cap evicts it, or on a
  session restored from a snapshot, which carries no screens. A cell can then
  keep stale content until something redraws it. The app never restores a
  session from a snapshot, mosh-server's throwaway number keeps the held
  screens far below the caps, and the server's fallback base (the oldest
  held) is never evicted.
- **The screen model follows the server's vocabulary only.** Sequences
  outside it (see patch 16) are ignored. A Host whose `wcwidth` disagrees
  with `MoshCharacterWidth` (a glibc Host on the scalars listed in patch 16,
  or a macOS whose libc changed since the table was generated) puts the
  model's cells off from the server's: the disagreement persists in the
  model until the server redraws those rows, and every repaint repeats it.
  A Ghostty that measures a character differently can misplace cells in a
  repaint until the next one.
- **Out-of-order datagrams are discarded** by sequence number
  (`TransportEngine.receivePayload`), so reordering costs states until the
  server re-bases.
- **No local echo prediction.** A keystroke shows once the server's frame
  carrying it arrives.

## Updating

Re-apply the patches above to the new upstream tree, then run the suite
against a real server (needs `mosh-server` on `PATH`):

```sh
SWIFTMOSH_REAL_E2E=1 swift test --package-path Packages/SwiftMosh
```
